## Important Notice

> Project report submission is scheduled for:
> Week 5 (Phase 1),
> Week 7 (Phase 2),
> Week 10 (Phase 3),
> Week 12 (activities and bonus) during the exercise.
>
> The pair will present their results to the instructor in a Jupyter Notebook. One member of the pair will then electronically submit the report to the AIS system by:
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 1),
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 2),
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 3),
> **12.12.202x 23:59** (activities with bonus points).
>
> If the submission deadline for the project phases and activities in AIS is missed, late submission is possible one week later, i.e., by:
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 1),
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 2),
> **xx.xx.202x 23:59** (Phase 3),
> **17.12.202x 23:59** (activities with bonus points),
> with a **50% penalty**.
> Later submission will not be accepted. Failure to submit any phase of the project or activities will result in not meeting the prerequisites for the exam (N).
